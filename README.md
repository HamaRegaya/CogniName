# CogniSmile: EmpowerAbility - AI-Assisted Support for Individuals with Down Syndrome

CogniSmile is an innovative project aimed at providing enhanced emotional understanding and support for individuals with Down Syndrome through the use of AI and real-time video analysis. The project leverages TensorFlow's deep learning capabilities and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to detect emotions in real-time videos, helping individuals with Down Syndrome better perceive the emotions of those around them, especially when others are feeling sad or angry.

  - Emotion detection (detecting sadness, anger, etc.)
  - User-friendly interface for individuals with Down Syndrome
- **Impact:** Improved emotional communication and interaction for people with Down Syndrome

## How It Works

CogniSmile employs a combination of deep learning techniques and computer vision to analyze real-time video streams. The project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) trained on emotional expression datasets to accurately recognize emotions such as sadness and anger. The AI model processes video frames, detects facial features, and provides real-time emotion feedback to the user. This assists individuals with Down Syndrome in understanding the emotions of others and enables more effective communication.
